9nt4oYZAu6Q,Just in from the news desk üì∞: The debut of DolphinGemma,2025-04-18T20:32:39Z,"Yes, It‚Äôs for real. We‚Äôre charting into the realm of interspecies communication. Today, we announce DolphinGemma, our wavebreaking new large language model! Built using Google's advanced AI technology, DolphinGemma functions as an audio-in, audio-out model, processes sequences of natural dolphin sounds to identify patterns, structure, and ultimately predict the likely subsequent sounds in a sequence, much like how large language models for human language predict the next word or token in a sentence. Trained with 40 years of dolphin research from the Wild Dolphin Project‚Äôs Dr. Denise Herzing and technical expertise from researchers at Georgia Tech, this model marks our first splash towards interspecies communication!
